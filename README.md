![Showcase Card](/public/static/twitter-card.png)

My personal website built off the amazing [astro-erudite](https://github.com/jktrn/astro-erudite.git) by [enscribe](https://enscribe.dev/) with Astro.js, Photoswipe, and Tailwindcss. 

I've added some personal flair as well as a gallery section to showcase some of my photography work. Hence, this blog contains a projects section, blog section, gallery section, about me section, and index page.

The about page is basically a web-friendly version of my resume.
