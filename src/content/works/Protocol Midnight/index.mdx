  > The Hiss is gone, but the silence it left behind is deafening.
  
  Jesse navigates the empty corridors of the Oldest House, trying to distinguish between her own thoughts and the resonance of an Entity that no longer speaks as loudly as it once did.

  Or: a story of leadership and loneliness.
