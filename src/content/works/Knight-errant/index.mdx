  Beidou, a curious, wide-eyed kid, had heard of stories: adventures of brave heroes slaying great monsters and saving their people. Always victorious in the end. Triumphant. Heart swelling with pride. And as the hero returns to his village, his people throw him an extravagant banquet. Beautiful women clamoring for his attention. His name inscribed on parchment and his image carved into stone, immortalizing him.

  But the stories do not tell her of the turmoil and trials of the hero. How he too, is only human, and loses battles and people. Family. Friends. Loved ones. They do not tell of grief, of death, of loss.

  The stories never tell her of tragedies, where happy endings are nowhere to be found.
