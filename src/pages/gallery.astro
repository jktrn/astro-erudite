        with a camera. At least that's what i've discovered in the past 2 years of photography.
        I've taken this camera with me to many places, from the blue eye in North Albania to the quaint kitchen of c√¥ (Aunty in Vietnamese) in the rural Vi Xuyen Village, Ha Giang, Vietnam. And with it, I've managed
        to capture some beautiful experiences that I will recall, years from now, with fondness and great clarity because of the photos I took.
