  In my 6-month stint at Resonance, I worked as the project head for two main projects, namely the redesign of the Ministry of Manpower's (MOM) Intranet, as well as the website for SUSS' open house. As the most experienced developer, I spearheaded the adoption of good coding practices, shifting away from hardcoded “responsive” design to truly responsive websites.
