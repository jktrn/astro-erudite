tagLine: A little about me...
---
I am extremely interested in the future of Mankind. As a city-dweller my entire life, I am painfully aware of the many technologies and systems in place that ensure that the daily lives of billions of people continue to run smoothly; Painfully aware because, while I recognize these systems, I cannot say I know how they run, nor can I say that I have contributed to their development in any way. And thus, it would be a dream to be able to contribute to any project, to say that I have adopted and played my part in the development of society.

I have experience working with Siemens TIA portal with both ladder and FBD languages. I took a course on microprocessor applications at NUS where I further improved my C++ and C programming skills, as well as gained a greater appreciation for the fundamentals of hardware engineering and integrated circuits.

I speak English as a mother tongue and Chinese as a second language. Having studied German for 2 years before spending 6 months in the south of Germany as an exchange student, I speak German at an intermediate level. Â 

In my free time, I like to sew, cook, bake, play the guitar, and dabble in photography. I also like to keep fit and play sports like basketball and skateboarding. If anything, I hope that my varied skillset and interests ranging the gamut of hobbies shows that I can pick things up quickly and will never back down in the face of hard work, nor pass up any opportunity for learning and personal development.
